				</h1>					
			
				<p>My name is Lindsay Eden and I am interested in working in the field of marketing and communications, and I excel at event planning.</p>
				
				<p>In order to work in this field, you have to work well under pressure and be able to handle the unexpected. You also need strong communication skills, something that comes in handy in any job. I feel as though through school and work experience, I have developed problem solving skills that would be beneficial to work in this field.</p>
				
				<p>I have a passion for creativity and I like to come up with new and exciting ideas. At the same time, I also love to be organized and I am referred to as the planner amongst my friends. I enjoy making lists and seeing things being checked off once completed. I am able to consider every aspect that needs to be planned in order to have an event run smoothly. Although I enjoy being a leader, I am also able to sit back and have someone delegate tasks to me.</p>
				
				<p>Alongside my passion for planning, I bring with me a positive attitude, and I am always trying to make people smile. I am told that I am empathetic, making me a good listener, and understanding of other peoples situations. These characteristics all attribute to my communication skills that help me in all aspects of my life, especially within the marketing and communications field.</p>
